An unfinished project originally meant to implemenet basic sieve methods (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) into numpy to see how fast one can compute primes in one second (inspired by the Sheafication of G video).

Segmented Sieve (NumPy)
GPU Acceleration (CuPy / CUDA)
Bit-packed logic for memory efficiency
Ï€(n) comparison vs Prime Number Theorem and Li(n)
Plots: density, gaps, approximation errors
